# Every 51Degrees environment variable name in this repository starts with an
# underscore, because a POSIX shell cannot set a name that starts with a digit,
# and each variable has one name with nothing read in its place. This reads
# every file git tracks, which leaves out build output and the submodules, and
# fails on any name that starts with the digit and on any fallback name.
#
# Names are matched in any case, because Windows reads an environment
# variable name in any case, so a lower case old name is still the old name
# there.
#
# Dot-sourcing the script defines Find-EnvironmentNameProblem without reading
# the repository, which is how its tests use it.
